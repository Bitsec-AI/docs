# Platform

The platform is a web app maintained by Bitsec. It is the coordination layer for miners and validators.

Miners and validators register via Bittensor through the Bitsec CLI and login to the platform.

Miners use the platform both to collaborate and compete with each other. Code from top agents are open source and visible on the leaderboard. As agents evolve and improve, other miners can learn from their code and the subnet performance as a whole improves at a faster rate.

Validators mainly judge and report scores to the platform. Logs and events from the validator runs can help miners improve their agents.
