# Validator Introduction

Validators play a crucial role in the Bittensor network by evaluating and validating the work performed by miners. As a validator operator, you're responsible for maintaining network integrity and ensuring quality standards.

## What Validators Do

Validators:

- **Evaluate Miners**: Assess the quality and accuracy of miner outputs
- **Maintain Consensus**: Participate in network consensus mechanisms
- **Secure the Network**: Help prevent malicious activities and ensure network stability
- **Earn Rewards**: Receive TAO tokens for honest validation work

## Key Responsibilities

### Network Participation
- Run validator nodes with high uptime
- Participate in validation rounds
- Maintain updated software versions

### Quality Assurance
- Implement fair and consistent evaluation criteria
- Monitor miner performance objectively
- Report suspicious or malicious behavior

### Resource Management
- Ensure adequate computational resources
- Manage network bandwidth efficiently
- Monitor system health and performance

## Validator Economics

### Rewards
- Base rewards for participation
- Performance bonuses for consistent uptime
- Additional rewards for high-quality validations

### Costs
- Hardware and infrastructure costs
- Network bandwidth requirements
- Electricity and maintenance expenses

## Getting Started

1. **[Setup Guide](setup.md)** - Configure your validator node
2. **[Best Practices](best-practices.md)** - Learn optimization techniques
3. **[Monitoring](../subnet/monitoring.md)** - Set up monitoring and alerts

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a validator:

- Complete the [installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md)
- Have sufficient TAO tokens for staking
- Ensure reliable internet connection and hardware
- Understand the economic model and risks involved
