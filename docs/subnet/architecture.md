2. **Efficiency**: Resource utilization and speed
3. **Innovation**: Novel approaches and improvements
4. **Reliability**: Consistent performance over time

#### Consensus Algorithm
```python
class ConsensusEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.validators = []
        self.consensus_threshold = 0.67
    
    def reach_consensus(self, validation_results):
        # Aggregate validator opinions
        weighted_scores = self.calculate_weighted_scores(validation_results)
        
        # Apply consensus algorithm
        consensus_score = self.apply_consensus_algorithm(weighted_scores)
        
        # Determine final result
        return consensus_score >= self.consensus_threshold
```

        base_reward = self.get_base_reward()
        performance_multiplier = self.calculate_performance_multiplier(performance_metrics)
        innovation_bonus = self.calculate_innovation_bonus(participant_id)
        
        total_reward = base_reward * performance_multiplier + innovation_bonus
        return total_reward
    
    def apply_slashing(self, participant_id, violation_type):
        # Slashing logic for violations
